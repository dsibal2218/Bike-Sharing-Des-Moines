# Bike-Sharing-Des-Moines2
**Overview**: We are asked to perform a bike trip analysis using the NYC CitiBike Share data to show details on how it works and how this could apply to Des Moines. 
During the class modules, we had performed multiple analysis and visualization using Tableau showing the total number of bike trips in August 2019, user type (short term customer
and annual subscriber) breakdown, peak riding hours, top starting and ending location, etc. We have to perform additional analyses to provide details as to how the bike sharing business could work in Des Moines.

## Requirements and Details of the Analysis

1. We are to use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype of the CitiBike 201908 data we already downloaded for the module.

2. Using the converted datatype, we are to create a set of visualizations to:

    a.  Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
    
    b.  Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

    c.  Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

    d.  Finally, we are to add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
